## Application Code
The `Application-Code` directory contains the source code for the Three-Tier Web Application. Dive into this directory to explore the frontend and backend implementations.

## Jenkins Pipeline Code
In the `Jenkins-Pipeline-Code` directory, you'll find Jenkins pipeline scripts. These scripts automate the CI/CD process, ensuring smooth integration and deployment of your application.

## Jenkins Server Terraform
Explore the `Jenkins-Server-TF` directory to find Terraform scripts for setting up the Jenkins Server on AWS. These scripts simplify the infrastructure provisioning process.

## Kubernetes Manifests Files
The `Kubernetes-Manifests-Files` directory holds Kubernetes manifests for deploying your application on AWS EKS. Understand and customize these files to suit your project needs.

## Project Details
🛠️ **Tools Explored:**
- Terraform & AWS CLI for AWS infrastructure
- Jenkins, Sonarqube, Terraform, Kubectl, and more for CI/CD setup
- Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana for Monitoring
- ArgoCD for GitOps practices

🚢 **High-Level Overview:**
- IAM User setup & Terraform magic on AWS
- Jenkins deployment with AWS integration
- EKS Cluster creation & Load Balancer configuration
- Private ECR repositories for secure image management
- Helm charts for efficient monitoring setup
- GitOps with ArgoCD - the cherry on top!

📈 **The journey covered everything from setting up tools to deploying a Three-Tier app, ensuring data persistence, and implementing CI/CD pipelines.**
